# California-Housing-Price-Prediction-using-a-Deep-Learning-Model
1. Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to build a deep learning model to predict median house values in California based on various socioeconomic and geographic factors. Accurate prediction of housing prices has implications for real estate investment, urban planning, and economic analysis.

2. Approach:

Data Acquisition: The project utilizes the California Housing dataset, a publicly available dataset from scikit-learn. This dataset contains information on housing characteristics and median house values for various block groups in California.
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were used to visualize data distributions, identify potential relationships between features, and handle missing values. Features were standardized to ensure consistent scaling for the neural network model.
Model Development: An artificial neural network (ANN) was built using TensorFlow/Keras. The model architecture consisted of three dense layers, including an input layer, a hidden layer with 64 neurons, and an output layer for predicting the median house value. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function was used for the input and hidden layers, while the output layer used a linear activation function.
Training and Evaluation: The model was trained using a subset of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set. Training involved optimizing the model's weights to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) loss. The model's performance was assessed using metrics like MSE and R-squared, indicating how well the model's predictions align with actual house values.
Visualization: Model training and performance were visualized using graphs to showcase the change in MSE and other metrics over epochs, illustrating how the model learned from the data.
3. Context:

This project demonstrates skills in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning, along with the application of popular libraries like Pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras. The project has practical implications in the domain of real estate, enabling stakeholders to gain insights into factors influencing housing prices and make informed decisions.
